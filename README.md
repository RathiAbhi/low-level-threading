This is a java project created to handle Multi-level Cache Management.
These types of questions are frequently asked in the low level design interviews.

This project handles the logic of extracting a file through some levels of cache and finding through them. If found, this also makes sure to write in the above levels where it could not be found.

Further extensions can be made here:
1. Eviction Policy (LRU or LFU cache)
2. Different storage mechanism for different levels (File storage or in-memory storage)
